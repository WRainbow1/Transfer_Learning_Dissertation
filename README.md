# Transfer_Learning_Dissertation

This repo contains the scripts and trained weights for my dissertation: applying Ganin and Lempitsky's transfer learning method to Structural Health Monitoring

As of 24/11/20, the author's paper model has been replicated and applied in PyTorch and used to transfer knowledge from the SVHN to MNIST datasets, replicating their results.
You can find the respective datasets here http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/, http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/, and use the implementation yourself.

Soon, the scripts for the SHM model will be uploaded too :).
